# FINAL ANALYSES AND FIGURE PLOTS
# This file is not meant to be ran directly. It should instead be read and adapted as needed.
# This uses results of computations from all other files


# Run the jupyter notebooks from perceptual-tuning-pnas/results as indicated below with the following libraries installed/on your pythonpath:
#   numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, itertools, h5features, scone-phobia (https://github.com/Thomas-Schatz/scone-phobia) and rala (https://github.com/Thomas-Schatz/rala)
# Change the hardcoded path(s) at the top of each notebook as appropriate for your system.
# Each notebook needs to access the results of some of the previous computations and expects those results to be organized with a particular folder structure and particular file naming conventions. To see the required folder structure and naming conventions you can access our original computation results at https://osf.io/d2fpb/. Here are some naming conventions that might not be completely transparent:
#  - DPGMM trained on full training set: dpgmm_novtln_vad
#  - DPGMM trained on subsets of training set: dpgmm_novtln_corpus
#  - supervised HMM baseline: AMtri1_sat_small_LMtri1satsmall
#  - MFCC baseline: mfcc_novtln
