# Creating a feature file with h5features (basic example) #
###########################################################
# For more, see the h5features doc (for example, see: http://h5features.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html#basic-usage)


1. Install h5features 

  1.1 Get a python install with numpy, scipy, h5py, etc. on path (the easiest is to use python-anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)

  1.2 run 'pip install h5features' in a terminal (another option is to install it from the git: https://github.com/bootphon/h5features)


2. Create the file

  2.1 Launch python and instantiate the following variables as desired:

      - feature_file: string indicating the path to the file where the features will be stored
      - utts: list of utterances id (as specified in 'segments.txt')
      - times: list of numpy arrays containing for each utterance a 1-d numpy array of size nf(utt) the number of feature frames for that utterance, containing timestamps in seconds, given relative to the beginning of the utterance (as specified in 'segments.txt')
      - feats: list of numpy arrays containing for each utterance a 2-d numpy array of size nf(utt) x d, where d is the dimension of the features space, containing the features for each frame of the utterance.

      (The order of utterances and frames should match across all lists and arrays. Frames should be given in increasing order of the timestamps)

  2.2. Run the following commands within python:

      import h5features as h5f
      with h5f.Writer(feature_file) as writer:   
        data = h5f.Data(utts, times, feats, check=True)
        writer.write(data, 'features')
