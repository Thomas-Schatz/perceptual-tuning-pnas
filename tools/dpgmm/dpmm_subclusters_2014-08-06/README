This is a version of the code from
  J. Chang and J. W. Fisher II, "Parallel Sampling of DP Mixtures
    Models using Sub-Cluster Splits". Neural Information Processing
    Systems (NIPS 2013), Lake Tahoe, NV, USA, Dec 2013.
very slightly modified by Thomas Schatz.

Original README:

  The following code is provided as is.  It was used in:

  [1] J. Chang and J. W. Fisher II, "Parallel Sampling of DP Mixtures
      Models using Sub-Cluster Splits". Neural Information Processing
      Systems (NIPS 2013), Lake Tahoe, NV, USA, Dec 2013.

  Any papers using this code should cite [1] accordingly.

  The software requires the following libraries:
  1) GNU Scientific Library: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
  2) Eigen library: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

  The software has been tested under Matlab R2012a and gcc 4.6.3.

  After unpacking the file and installing the required libraries,
  start Matlab and run the following:

  >> cd <root dir>/Gaussian
  >> compile_MEX
  >> cd <root dir>/Multinomial
  >> compile_MEX

  If no errors are reported, you can then run demo.m in the Gaussian
  or Multinomial directories.

  If errors are reported, you may need to debug a little:
  1) Check the installation of GSL and Eigen.
  2) Check to make sure your compiler supports OpenMP
  3) If you are not running a Linux OS, try commenting out the line with
       "DFLAGS = [DFLAGS ' -DUSESTOPWATCH '];"
     This will disable timing, but still allow the algorithms to run.

  If all else fails, you can try to email me at jchang7@csail.mit.edu.
  I will try to help if I can.
